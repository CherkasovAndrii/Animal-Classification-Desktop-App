# Animal Classification Desktop Application
This project is a desktop application for animal classification using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model. 
The application allows users to upload an image, predict the animal class, and view past predictions. The backend is powered by Flask, and the frontend is created using Tkinter.

# Features
## Upload Image: Upload an image to classify.
### Predictions: View the predicted class of the uploaded image.
### Past Predictions: View past predictions with the associated images.
# Options:
### Choose from three(two) pre-trained models or upload yours.
### Change application resolution.

# Models
# Two pre-trained models are available for selection, you can get them on kaggle:
## Second is better but pre-selected is model one, to make more precise predictions use the second model

## [Model One(old, vgg16 based)](https://www.kaggle.com/models/vitaliyblackhole/classify-animals)
## [Model Two(new, vgg16 based)](https://www.kaggle.com/models/vitaliyblackhole/updated-vgg16)

# Second model accuracy, loss, rmse

## Make a new prediction. User can choose from whatever he wants like upload an image take a picture with a webcam or use a yolo model to predict
